The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 26.3% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 95.9% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 23.2% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 5.8 hours of data, or 4.3 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 10.1% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (22,31.4,95)
