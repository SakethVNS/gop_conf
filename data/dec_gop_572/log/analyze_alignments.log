The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 28.3% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 95.8% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 25.2% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 5.7 hours of data, or 4.1 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 10.7% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (23,32.1,97)
