The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 0.0% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 96.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 0.0% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 6.2 hours of data, or 6.2 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 0.0% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (0,0.0,0)
