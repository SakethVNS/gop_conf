The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 26.4% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 99.7% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 26.3% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 2.1 hours of data, or 1.5 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 13.1% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (4,8.8,32)
